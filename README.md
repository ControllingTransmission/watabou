## Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ControllingTransmission/watabou.git
cd watabou
yarn
```

## Usage (development)

Run `webpack-dev-server` (all bundles will be served from memory)

```shell
yarn dev
```

Go to `localhost:8080` to see your project live!

## Usage (production)

Generate all js/css bundles:

```shell
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `build/` directory, ready for deployment.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

This project automatically deploys to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. Every push to the `master` branch triggers a build and deployment to `https://controllingtransmission.github.io/watabou/`.

## Other

Analyze webpack bundles offline:

```shell
yarn build  # to generate build/stats.json
yarn stats  # uses webpack-bundle-analyzer as CLI
```

or push to a CI (e.g. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/)), let it build your project and analyze your bundles online at [packtracker.io](https://packtracker.io/).

Check outdated dependencies:

```shell
yarn ncu
```

Update all outdated dependencies at once:

```shell
yarn ncuu
```

## TODO

Some desired things in our new version here:

* Move object generation and control into a required file. Too much in application.js right now.
* Force lint success on commit.
* Write some documentation on how to use the linter to begin with.
* Add gamepad support: https://github.com/carldanley/node-gamepad

## Credits

The setup of this starter project was inspired by two snippets on Codepen: [this one](http://codepen.io/mo4_9/pen/VjqRQX) and [this one](https://codepen.io/iamphill/pen/jPYorE).

I understood how to work with lights and camera helpers thanks to
[this snippet](http://jsfiddle.net/f17Lz5ux/5131/) on JSFiddle.

The code for `vertexShader.glsl` and `fragmentShader.glsl` is taken from
[this blog post](http://blog.cjgammon.com/threejs-custom-shader-material).
